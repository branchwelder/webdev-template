# Template Project

This template project uses `vite` to run a dev server and build the project. It
uses `gh-pages` to deploy the site to the `gh-pages` branch.

## Using the template

Clone the repository to your computer. Open it in your editor. Install
dependencies with `npm install`

- `npm run start` - runs the local development server
- `npm run host` - runs the local development server, but makes it accessible on
  your network (so you could e.g. open the site on your phone)
- `npm run build` - builds your site to the `dist` folder
- `npm run preview` - builds your site and previews the built version locally
- `npm run deploy` - builds your site and then deploys it to github pages
